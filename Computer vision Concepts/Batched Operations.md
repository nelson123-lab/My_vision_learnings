- Batched operations in computer vision refer to performing operations on multiple images simultaneously, rather than processing each image individually. This is 
  done by grouping multiple images into a batch and then applying the same operation to all images in the batch at once.

- Batched operations are commonly used in deep learning models for computer vision tasks, such as image classification or object detection. By processing multiple 
  images in parallel, batched operations can significantly improve the efficiency of these models, reducing the time required for training and inference.

- In addition to improving efficiency, batched operations can also help to improve the accuracy of computer vision models. By processing multiple images 
  together, the model can learn to generalize better across different images, leading to more robust and accurate predictions.
