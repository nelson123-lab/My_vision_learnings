Photogrammetry is a technique used to create accurate 3D models or measurements of objects or scenes using photographs. It involves extracting 3D information from 2D images by analyzing the geometric relationships between the objects and the camera.

The process of photogrammetry typically involves the following steps:

1. Image Acquisition: Multiple overlapping images of the object or scene are captured from different viewpoints. These images should cover the object or scene from various angles to 
   ensure good coverage and depth information.

2. Feature Extraction: In this step, distinctive features or keypoints are identified and extracted from the images. These features could be corners, edges, or other visually unique points that 
   can be easily matched across different images.

3. Image Matching: The extracted features from different images are matched to establish correspondences between them. This is typically done by finding similar or corresponding keypoints in different images.

4. Camera Pose Estimation: Using the matched feature correspondences, the relative camera positions and orientations (camera poses) for each image can be estimated. This allows mapping the 2D images 
   to a 3D coordinate system.

5. Dense Reconstruction: Once the camera poses are estimated, the next step is to reconstruct a dense 3D point cloud or mesh representation of the scene or object. This involves estimating the 3D coordinates 
   of each pixel in the images by triangulating the corresponding rays from multiple camera viewpoints.

6. Refinement and Texturing: The initial 3D reconstruction may have some inaccuracies or inconsistencies. Additional processing steps, such as bundle adjustment and mesh refinement, can be applied to 
   improve the accuracy and completeness of the 3D model. Texture information from the images can also be applied to the 3D model to enhance its visual appearance.

Photogrammetry finds applications in various fields such as architecture, archaeology, geology, virtual reality, and entertainment. It enables the creation of 3D models for visualization, measurements, simulations, or 
virtual reconstructions based on real-world objects or scenes.
