In computer vision, projection matrices are used to represent the transformation from 3D world coordinates to 2D image coordinates. They are commonly employed 
in various tasks such as camera calibration, 3D reconstruction, and object tracking.

A projection matrix combines the intrinsic parameters of a camera (related to its internal characteristics) and the extrinsic parameters (related to its 
position and orientation in the world) into a single matrix. The intrinsic parameters typically include the focal length, principal point coordinates, and 
lens distortion parameters. The extrinsic parameters define the position and orientation of the camera with respect to the world coordinate system.

The most commonly used projection matrix is the 3x4 matrix, which maps 3D homogeneous coordinates (X, Y, Z, 1) to 2D homogeneous image coordinates (x, y, w). 
The projection can be represented by the equation:

[sx * fx   0      cx     0]   [X]
[0        sy * fy  cy     0] * [Y]
[0         0      1      0]   [Z]
                             [1]
where (X, Y, Z) are the 3D world coordinates, (x, y) are the 2D image coordinates, (fx, fy) are the focal lengths along the x and y axes, (cx, cy) are the 
principal point coordinates (the image coordinates of the optical center), and (sx, sy) are scaling factors that account for potential pixel aspect ratio.
The projection matrix can be computed through camera calibration techniques, which involve capturing images of a known calibration pattern and estimating 
the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters using algorithms like Direct Linear Transform (DLT) or Zhang's method.
Once the projection matrix is known, it allows for the transformation of 3D points into 2D image coordinates, enabling various computer vision tasks such 
as object pose estimation, depth estimation, and 3D object rendering.
