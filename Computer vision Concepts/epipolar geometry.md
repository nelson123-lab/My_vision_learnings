Epipolar geometry is a fundamental concept in computer vision that relates the geometry between two views of a scene captured by different cameras. 
It provides constraints on the correspondence between points in the two views, which is crucial for tasks such as stereo vision, structure from motion, and 
visual odometry.

The epipolar geometry is derived from the geometry of the two camera views and is defined by the epipolar plane, epipolar lines, and the epipole. Let's 
consider two cameras, denoted as Camera 1 and Camera 2. The epipole is the point in Camera 2 that corresponds to the optical center of Camera 1, and vice versa. 
The epipolar plane contains the baseline (line connecting the two camera centers) and all the 3D points in the scene. The intersection of the epipolar plane 
with the image planes of Camera 1 and Camera 2 defines the epipolar lines.

The key property of epipolar geometry is that the correspondence of a point in one view lies on the corresponding epipolar line in the other view. This 
constraint greatly simplifies the task of finding correspondences between points in stereo images or tracking objects across multiple frames.

Epipolar geometry is typically expressed using the essential matrix (for calibrated cameras) or the fundamental matrix (for uncalibrated cameras). These 
matrices encapsulate the epipolar constraints and can be used to estimate the camera motion, reconstruct 3D structure, or validate correspondences.

Applications of epipolar geometry include stereo matching, where the epipolar constraint reduces the search space for finding correspondences, and structure 
from motion, where it helps to estimate the 3D structure of a scene from multiple views.

In summary, epipolar geometry provides geometric constraints that allow for efficient and accurate matching of points between different camera views, 
enabling a wide range of computer vision tasks.
