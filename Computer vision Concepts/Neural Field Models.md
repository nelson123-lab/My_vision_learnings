Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are a class of models used in computer graphics and computer vision to represent complex 3D scenes. NeRF models aim to capture the appearance and geometry of a scene by 
learning a continuous volumetric representation from a set of input images.

Traditional 3D modeling techniques rely on explicit geometric representations such as meshes or point clouds. NeRF, on the other hand, represents the scene as a continuous function that maps 3D coordinates 
to radiance values (color and intensity). This function is typically implemented using neural networks, specifically deep fully-connected networks or convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

The key idea behind NeRF is to train a neural network to predict the radiance value for any given 3D point in the scene, based on its coordinates. During training, NeRF models are provided with a set of 
images captured from different viewpoints along with corresponding camera poses. The model learns to reconstruct the underlying scene by predicting the radiance values for various points and combining 
them to generate a coherent image.

NeRF models can capture detailed surface textures, lighting effects, and complex scene interactions, resulting in highly realistic renderings. They excel at synthesizing novel views of a scene, 
allowing for interactive navigation and exploration in virtual environments. However, NeRF models can be computationally expensive to train and require substantial amounts of data.
