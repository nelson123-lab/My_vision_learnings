- ' gather ', on the other hand, is used to gather the values of a tensor from another tensor according to a specified index. It takes in two inputs: the input 
  tensor and the index tensor. The index tensor specifies the indices from which to gather the values of the input tensor.

- For example, if we have an input tensor of shape (3, 4) and an index tensor of shape (2, 2), we can use gather to gather the values of the input tensor at 
  indices (0, 1) and (2, 3) as follows:
  
```python
input = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]])
index = torch.tensor([[0, 1], [2, 3]])
output = input.gather(1, index)
```
