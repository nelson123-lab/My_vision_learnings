## Applications in Manufactoring Industry
There are several applications in which computer vison is used in manufactoring industry.

Bin Picking
- A common industrial robotics application, bin pickingis the action of selecting an object from a bin, picking it up, and placing it in another location.

Machine tending
- Machine tending is the process of automatically loading raw material or components for input into a machine. This includes placing parts on a conveyor belt, as well as
  preparing materials for welding, grinding, milling, or injection molds.

Defect Detection
- Computer vision has already become indispensable in ensuring quality control in industrial processes. Instance segmentation, for instance, is used in conjunction with high-resolution 
  sensor data, to check if a manufactured part has the desired spatial dimensions, within an allowed tolerance.

Predictive maintenance
- Tools and machinery in manufacturing plants gradually accumulate wear and tear which, if left untreated, could lead to complete breakdown, as well as potential injuries and lost productivity.
- To avoid such failure, manufacturers have historically performed routine maintenance, cleaning, refurbishing, and changing out old parts on a regular basis.

Palletizing and depalletizing
- Pallets have been called the unsung heroes of our modern age. These flat, typically wooden, platforms are essential to the scale and economy of global logistics and transportation. Before pallets make their 
  way to shipping containers, they are loaded up with goods. These stacks of goods can reach up to 15 feet tall and weigh more than two tons. The process of loading and stacking products onto a pallet is known 
  as palletizing. Similarly, once products have reached their destination, they must be unloaded from the pallet. This unloading process is referred to as depalletizing.
