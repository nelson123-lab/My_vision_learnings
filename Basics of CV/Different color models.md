A RGB image and a CMYK image are two different color models used in digital imaging and printing.

RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue, which are the primary colors of light. In an RGB image, colors are created by combining different intensities of red, green, and blue light. RGB is commonly used in digital displays, such as computer monitors and televisions. It is an additive color model, meaning that when all three primary colors are combined at full intensity, they create white light.

On the other hand, CMYK stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (Black). CMYK is a subtractive color model used in printing. In a CMYK image, colors are created by subtracting different amounts of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink from a white background. CMYK is used in the printing process because it is more suitable for mixing inks and reproducing a wide range of colors on paper.

The main difference between RGB and CMYK is the way colors are represented and produced. RGB is used for digital displays, while CMYK is used for printing. When preparing an image for print, it is important to convert it from RGB to CMYK to ensure accurate color reproduction.
