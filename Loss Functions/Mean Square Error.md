- This is a common loss function used for regression problems. It measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
- Used to evaluate the performance of image processing algorithms. 
- It is used to measure the difference between the predicted and actual pixel values in an image.

- MSE is often used in tasks such as image denoising, image restoration, and image super-resolution. In these tasks, the goal is to produce an output image that is     as close as possible to the ground truth image. MSE is used to quantify the difference between the predicted and ground truth images, and is often used as a loss     function during training of deep learning models.

- MSE is also used in evaluating the performance of image compression algorithms. In this case, the MSE is used to measure the difference between the original and     compressed images. A lower MSE indicates that the compressed image is closer to the original image, and therefore, the compression algorithm is considered to be of   higher quality.
