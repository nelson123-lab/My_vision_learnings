- This is a loss function used for binary classification problems. It measures the difference between the predicted and actual class probabilities.
- It is used to measure the difference between the predicted and actual class labels of an image.
- In computer vision, binary cross-entropy is often used in tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and image classification. In these tasks, the 
  goal is to classify an image into one of two categories, such as "object present" or "object absent". Binary cross-entropy is used to calculate the loss during training of deep learning models that are used for these tasks.
- Binary cross-entropy is also used in tasks that involve multi-label classification, where an image can belong to multiple categories at the same time. In this case, binary cross-entropy is applied to each label separately, and the losses are summed to obtain the total loss.
--Overall, binary cross-entropy is a versatile loss function that is widely used in computer vision tasks that involve binary or multi-label classification.
