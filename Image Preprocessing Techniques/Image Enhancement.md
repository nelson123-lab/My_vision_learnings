1. Contrast enhancement: 
   This technique is used to increase the contrast between different parts of an image. It can be done by adjusting the brightness and contrast 
   of the image or by using histogram equalization.

2. Noise reduction: 
   This technique is used to remove noise from an image. It can be done by using filters such as median filter, Gaussian filter, or bilateral filter.

3. Sharpening: 
   This technique is used to enhance the edges and details in an image. It can be done by using filters such as Laplacian filter or unsharp mask filter.

4. Color correction: 
   This technique is used to correct the color balance of an image. It can be done by adjusting the color channels or by using color correction algorithms.

5. Image resizing: 
   This technique is used to change the size of an image. It can be done by using interpolation algorithms such as nearest neighbor, bilinear, or bicubic.
