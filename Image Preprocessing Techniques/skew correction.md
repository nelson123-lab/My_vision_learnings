Skew correction is a technique used in computer vision to correct the orientation of an image that is tilted or slanted. There are several skew correction techniques in computer vision that can be used to correct the orientation of an image. Some of the most common techniques include:

1. Hough transform: 
   This technique is used to detect lines in an image and can be used to determine the angle of rotation needed to correct the skew.

2. Projection profile: 
   This technique involves projecting the image onto a horizontal or vertical axis and analyzing the resulting profile to determine the angle of rotation needed to  correct the skew.

3. Fourier transform: 
   This technique involves applying a Fourier transform to the image and analyzing the resulting frequency spectrum to determine the angle of rotation needed to correct the skew.

4. Template matching: 
   This technique involves comparing the image to a set of templates that are rotated at different angles and selecting the template that best matches the image.

5. Contour analysis:
   This technique involves analyzing the contours of the image to determine the angle of rotation needed to correct the skew.
