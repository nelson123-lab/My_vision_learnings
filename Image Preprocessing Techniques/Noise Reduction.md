There are several noise reduction techniques in computer vision that can be used to remove noise from an image. Some of the most common techniques include:

1. Median filter: 
   This technique replaces each pixel in an image with the median value of its neighboring pixels. It is effective in removing salt-and-pepper noise.

2. Gaussian filter: 
   This technique applies a Gaussian blur to an image, which smooths out the noise. It is effective in removing Gaussian noise.

3. Bilateral filter: 
   This technique is a non-linear filter that preserves edges while removing noise. It works by applying a weighted average to the neighboring pixels, where the     weights are based on both the spatial distance and the intensity difference between the pixels.

4. Non-local means filter: 
   This technique is a denoising algorithm that works by averaging similar patches in an image. It is effective in removing Gaussian noise and preserving image details.

5. Wavelet transform:
   This technique decomposes an image into different frequency bands and applies noise reduction to each band separately. It is effective in removing noise while preserving image details.
