The Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD) benchmark is a large-scale dataset for autonomous driving research. It was created by researchers at UC Berkeley and contains over 100,000 video frames and corresponding lidar point clouds, along with annotations for object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.
The BDD benchmark is unique in that it focuses on real-world driving scenarios, including urban, suburban, and highway driving. The dataset contains a wide variety of weather and lighting conditions, making it a great resource for developing and testing algorithms for autonomous vehicles.
In addition to the dataset, the BDD benchmark also includes a set of evaluation metrics and a leaderboard for comparing the performance of different algorithms. This makes it a great resource for researchers and developers who are working on autonomous driving applications.
Overall, the BDD benchmark is a valuable resource for the autonomous driving community and has been used in many research projects and competitions. It is a great dataset for developing and testing new algorithms and models for a variety of autonomous driving tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.
