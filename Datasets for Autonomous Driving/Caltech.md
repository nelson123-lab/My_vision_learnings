The Caltech dataset is another popular computer vision dataset that contains a large number of images and videos of everyday scenes. The dataset was 
collected by the California Institute of Technology and contains over 10,000 images and 
20 hours of video footage. The dataset is often used for object recognition, object detection, and tracking tasks.
One of the unique features of the Caltech dataset is that it contains a large number of images and videos captured from a moving vehicle. This makes it a 
great dataset for developing and testing algorithms for autonomous vehicles and robotics applications.
The Caltech dataset also contains a variety of object categories, including pedestrians, cars, bicycles, and buses. This makes it a great dataset for 
training object detection and tracking models.
Overall, the Caltech dataset is a valuable resource for the computer vision community and has been used in many research projects and competitions. It is a 
great dataset for developing and testing new algorithms and models for a variety of computer vision tasks.
