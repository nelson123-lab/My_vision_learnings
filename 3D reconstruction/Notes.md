The basic outline of the of a 3D reconstruction project will be:

1. Image Acquisition: You'll need a set of 2D images of the object from different angles. You can either take these photos yourself or find a dataset online.
2. Feature Matching: This involves identifying the same points in different images. OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, has functions for this.
3. Estimate Motion: Once you have matched points, you can estimate the motion between pairs of images. This is typically done using methods like the eight-point algorithm.
4. Triangulation: After estimating motion, you can triangulate 3D points from the corresponding points in the 2D images.
5. Bundle Adjustment: This is an optimization process that refines your 3D model to minimize the error in reprojecting your 3D points back onto the 2D images.
6. Visualization: Finally, you can visualize your 3D model. There are many libraries available for this, such as matplotlib or Mayavi in Python.
